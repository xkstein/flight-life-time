So if there is one commercial plane crash every 20 million flights, and you've got x more years to live in general, we can find your average lifespan if you take this flight.

$\frac{(20000000 - 1) * x + 0}{20000000} = \text{average lifespan after taking this flight}$

By subtracting this from your predicted lifespan, we can find the average ammount of time it'll cost you to take this flight.

$x - \frac{20000000-1}{20000000}x=\frac{1}{20000000}x=\text{Average time lost by dying in a flight}$

So if it takes y more hours for you to drive to your destination, you would need to be planning to live to

$20000000 x = y$

in order to have a greater average loss of time than the extra time driving
